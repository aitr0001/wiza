        <p> 
            Hello! My name is Ouiza , and I am currently a student at Algonquin college , stuying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>
        I have never imagined myself in this field , but destiny played a big role. At first,it was quite challenging because everything was new to me . However, I quickly grew to love the process of taking an idea and transforming it into reality.
         </p>
         <p>
            Everyday presents new challenges,but I am very focussed to learn and progress step by step. Apart from my studies, I love traveling and discovering new places, spending time with my dog and preparing new recepies to my family and freinds these things inspire joy and positivity in my daily life.
         </p>
